# Analysis Reports

This directory contains comprehensive analysis reports generated by the Z-Framework unified mathematical system.

## Contents

### Core Analysis Reports
- **`analysis_report.json`** - Primary system analysis report with key metrics and findings
- **`comprehensive_z_model_results.json`** - Complete Z-model validation results and mathematical proofs

### Test Instance Results  
- **`tc_inst_01_results_*.json`** - Timestamped test case execution results from TC01-TC05 validation suite
  - Multiple execution instances with statistical validation data
  - Includes prime density enhancement measurements and confidence intervals

## Analysis Framework

Per KBLLM.txt knowledge base structure:
- **Statistical Significance**: p-values < 10^-6
- **Validation Status**: TC01-TC05 80% pass rate  
- **Precision Requirements**: mpmath dps=50+ for numerical stability
- **Cross-validation**: Multiple implementations for reproducibility verification

## Usage

These reports contain the empirical validation data supporting the core mathematical discoveries in the Z-Framework, including:
- Prime clustering analysis with geometric constraints
- Variance minimization through curvature-adaptive geodesics  
- Golden ratio transformation optimizations
- Zeta zero correlations and helical embeddings

Generated automatically by the validation suite and cross-validation frameworks.
