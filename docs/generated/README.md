# Generated Documentation

This directory contains automatically generated analysis reports and documentation produced by the unified framework's various computational analyses.

## Directory Structure

### Geodesic Clustering Reports (`geodesic-clustering/`)

Analysis reports examining clustering behavior in geodesic embeddings for primes and zeta zeros:

- **`basic/`** - Basic example analysis reports
- **`advanced/`** - Advanced multi-dimensional analysis reports (3D, 4D, 5D)
- **`demos/`** - Demonstration and example reports  
- **`tests/`** - Test execution reports
- **`production/`** - Production-level analysis reports
- **`validation/`** - Validation and verification reports

### Variance Analysis Reports (`variance-analysis/`)

Statistical analysis reports examining variance relationships and mathematical properties:

- **`basic/`** - Basic variance analysis reports
- **`enhanced/`** - Comprehensive and enhanced variance analysis reports

## About Generated Reports

These reports are automatically generated by the framework's analysis tools and contain:

- **Methodology descriptions** - How the analysis was performed
- **Statistical results** - Quantitative findings and metrics
- **Visualizations** - Charts, plots, and mathematical representations
- **Interpretations** - Analysis conclusions and mathematical insights

## Report Types

### Geodesic Clustering Reports
Comprehensive analysis of geodesic embeddings comparing primes, zeta zeros, and random distributions using various clustering algorithms (KMeans, DBSCAN, Agglomerative) with statistical validation.

### Variance Analysis Reports  
Mathematical analysis examining variance relationships of the form `var(O) ~ log log N` with linear and power law model fitting, correlation analysis, and Z Framework interpretations.

## Usage

These reports are generated automatically during framework execution and can be referenced for:
- Understanding analysis outcomes
- Validating mathematical models
- Documenting computational results
- Supporting research conclusions

For information on how these reports are generated, see the main framework documentation in `docs/core/` and `docs/validation/`.
