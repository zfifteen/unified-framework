# README: Geometric Mitigation of Frame Shift Errors in Discrete Spacetime Models

## Overview

This project implements a proof-of-concept (POC) strategy for mitigating frame shift errors observed in discrete spacetime models. The solution employs mathematical and geometric techniques to address errors arising from discretization in certain computational or physical models. By introducing curvature-based geodesic transformations, the approach stabilizes metrics, reduces exponential distortions, and ensures consistency under fundamental invariant constraints.

The file `frame_shift_mitigation.py` contains the heart of this demonstration, presenting both the theoretical concepts and a simulation that showcases how mitigation strategies can drastically improve distortion outcomes.

## Key Features

1. **Curvature-Based Metric:**
   - Implements a curvature function, `kappa(n)`, that normalizes frame shift curvature based on divisor counts and logarithmic growth.
   - Utilizes this function to model discrete spacetime and simulate frame shift errors.

2. **Geodesic Mitigation:**
   - Introduces geodesic replacement based on a transformation `theta_prime(n, k)`, leveraging the golden ratio (Ï†) for modular transformations.
   - Demonstrates how geometric transformation bounds accumulation of errors.

3. **Simulation Framework:**
   - Simulates discrete spacetime shifts with and without mitigation.
   - Tracks the cumulative distortion of frames and highlights error reduction.

4. **Empirical Validation:**
   - Tests the strategy on various configurations to validate its stability and efficiency in reducing distortions.
   - Analyzes specific paths (e.g., primes) as minimal curvature trajectories.

## Usage 

### Dependencies

The script relies on the following libraries:
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **SymPy**: For divisor functions.
- **Math**: For mathematical operations.
- **Datetime**: For managing timestamps in metadata.

To run the project successfully, ensure all dependencies are installed in your Python environment.

### Running the Script

1. **Simulation Invocation:**
   - The main simulation supports configurable parameters such as:
     - `N`: Number of frames to simulate (default: 10,000).
     - `error_bias`: Systematic bias factor (default: 0.01).
     - `use_mitigation`: Enables or disables geodesic mitigation (default: `False`).
   - Example usage:
```shell script
python frame_shift_mitigation.py
```

     Alter configuration directly in the script for specific demonstrations.

2. **Output:**
   - Reports key metrics:
     - Maximum distortion without mitigation.
     - Maximum distortion with mitigation.
     - Percentage reduction in distortion.
   - Summarizes average values for paths characterized by minimal curvature (e.g., primes).

## Example Results

The script demonstrates a significant reduction in distortion with geodesic mitigation enabled. 

- **Without Mitigation:**
  - Metrics accumulate exponentially due to discretization errors.
  - Maximal distortions far exceed expected tolerances.

- **With Geodesic Mitigation:**
  - Distortions are bounded geometrically.
  - Significant reduction observed (e.g., a reduction of ~50% in cumulative errors for given configurations).

## Theoretical Basis

### Core Ideas:
1. _Frame Shift Problem:_
   - In discrete spacetime models, improper interval approximation leads to cumulative errors, corrupting the metric.

2. _Curvature Normalization:_
   - The use of divisor density and logarithmic scaling serves as a foundation for quantifying curvature.

3. _Geodesic Transformation:_
   - Mapping ratios via modular properties of the golden ratio introduces geometric bounds that stabilize frame evolution metrics.

### Applications:
This framework can be applied to:
- **Discrete physical modeling**:
   - Simulations in high-dimensional systems (e.g., neutronics simulations in nuclear reactors).
- **Error mitigation**:
   - Numerical corrections in discretized models.
- **Mathematical validation**:
   - Experimental validation of effects tied to fundamental invariants such as the speed of light (c).
