# A Log-Concave Transform of the Riemann Xi Function and Its Connection to Prime Structure

---

## Abstract Overview

Given a sequence $\alpha = (a_k)_{k \geq 0}$ of nonnegative numbers, a transformation $\mathcal{L}(\alpha) = (b_k)_{k \geq 0}$ with $b_k = a_k^2 - a_{k-1}a_{k+1}$ is defined, and a sequence is called $r$-log-concave if iterative application of $\mathcal{L}$ yields a nonnegative sequence for all $1 \leq i \leq r$. This machinery is applied to sequences arising from Taylor coefficients of the Riemann $\xi$-function, with direct implications for some of the deepest problems in analytic number theory and the structure of primes. A central result is the establishment of 6-log-concavity for the $\xi$-function’s Taylor coefficients, advancing understanding of their infinite log-concavity, a conjecture intimately connected to the Riemann hypothesis and the distribution of prime numbers. Applications, computational criteria, and connections to $q$-analogs and combinatorial sequences such as $q$-binomial coefficients and $q$-Stirling numbers are discussed—underscoring the far-reaching effects of log-concavity in number theory and combinatorics.

## Introduction and Literature Review

### The Riemann $\xi$-Function and the Prime Structure

The Riemann $\xi$-function,
$$
\xi(s) = \frac{1}{2} s(s-1) \pi^{-s/2} \Gamma(s/2)\zeta(s),
$$
where $\zeta(s)$ is the Riemann zeta function, is a real entire function of order one and maximal type. It satisfies the functional equation $\xi(1-s) = \xi(s)$ and—fundamentally for analytic number theory—can be expanded around $s$ as
$$
\xi(\sigma+1/2) = \sum_{m=0}^\infty \lambda_m \sigma^{2m},
$$
where
$$
\lambda_m = 8 \frac{4^m}{(2m)!} \int_0^\infty t^{2m}\Phi(t) \, dt,
$$
and $\Phi(t)$ is an explicit rapidly decaying function incorporating exponential and trigonometric terms tied to the Jacobi theta function and modular forms. The critical sequence $(\lambda_m)$ contains profound information about the nontrivial zeros of $\xi(s)$, which by the Hadamard factorization,
$$
\xi(s) = \xi(0) \prod_{\rho}\left(1 - \frac{s}{\rho}\right)e^{s/\rho},
$$
encode the distribution of primes via the explicit formulas connecting zeros of $\zeta(s)$ to fluctuations in the prime counting function.

A central theme in modern research is the connection between the real-rootedness (hyperbolicity) and log-concavity of these sequences and the Riemann hypothesis. The Riemann hypothesis asserts that all nontrivial zeros of $\xi(s)$ lie on the critical line $\operatorname{Re}(s)=1/2$, tantamount to deep regularity in the spacing of prime numbers. By Pólya’s work, the Riemann hypothesis is, in fact, equivalent to the statement that all associated Jensen polynomials are hyperbolic (all zeros are real), a property intricately linked to the infinite log-concavity of the $(\lambda_k)$.

### Historical and Contemporary Research Threads

The study of log-concavity and its implications for analytic number theory finds its lineage in the works of Newton (Newton’s inequalities) and extends via Turán-type inequalities, early explorations of combinatorial log-concavity, and more recent advances in total positivity and $q$-analogues. Fundamental studies, such as those by Boros and Moll on polynomial log-concavity, and Kauers and Paule on the log-concavity of combinatorial polynomial families, form a backdrop for recent breakthroughs regarding the Taylor coefficients of the Riemann $\xi$-function, notably showing $r$-log-concavity for $r$ up to 6 and conjecturing its infinitude.

Simultaneously, deep algebraic and geometric connections have emerged, linking log-concave transforms to spectral properties, the Legendre and Laplace transforms, the geometry of convex bodies, and modern Hodge-theoretic approaches in combinatorics. The investigation of the Jacobi theta function’s log-concavity and its role as the Fourier kernel in $\Xi$-function analyses further highlights the cross-pollination of algebraic, analytical, and combinatorial insights in this line of research.

## Mathematical Preliminaries and Definitions

### Log-Concavity and Iterated Log-Concavity

A sequence $(a_k)_{k\geq 0}$ is **log-concave** if $a_k^2 \geq a_{k-1}a_{k+1}$ for all indices $k$. The **log-concave transform** operator $\mathcal{L}$ is defined by
$$
b_k = a_k^2 - a_{k-1}a_{k+1}.
$$
A sequence is said to be **$r$-log-concave** if repeated application $\mathcal{L}^i(\alpha) \geq 0$ for all $1 \leq i \leq r$, and **infinitely log-concave** if this holds for all $i \geq 1$.

Analogously, for a nonnegative function $f$, log-concavity is equivalent to $\log f$ being concave, or, for differentiable functions,
$$
(f'(x))^2 - f(x)f''(x) \geq 0.
$$
In multivariate and continuous settings, log-concave measures are measures whose density is log-concave, leading to broad preservation properties under products, linear transformations, marginalizations, and convolutions.

### Real-Rootedness, The Laguerre-Pólya Class, and Jensen Polynomials

A real entire function is in the **Laguerre-Pólya class** if it is a uniform limit of polynomials with only real zeros or, equivalently, can be written as
$$
f(x) = c x^n e^{\gamma x} \prod_{j \geq 1}(1 + \alpha_jx),
$$
with $c, \gamma, \alpha_j \geq 0$, $\sum_{j} \alpha_j < \infty$. The **Jensen polynomials**
$$
g_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \gamma_k x^k
$$
arising from the coefficients of the $\xi$-function are critical, as their real-rootedness is another necessary and sufficient condition for the Riemann hypothesis.

### Total Positivity, Newton's and Turán's Inequalities

**Total positivity** for matrices plays a secondary but influential role: it refers to matrices whose minors are all nonnegative, often ensuring sequences transformed by certain linear operations preserve log-concavity. Newton’s inequalities provide one set of necessary conditions for log-concavity, stating for a sequence with a real-rooted generating function,
$$
a_k^2 \geq a_{k-1}a_{k+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k}\right)\left(1 + \frac{1}{n - k}\right).
$$
**Turán-type inequalities**—which in this context take the form $a_k^2 \geq C_{k} a_{k-1}a_{k+1}$ with explicit constants $C_k$—also provide critical analytic constraints linking log-concavity to underlying root structures, especially meaningful for the Riemann $\xi$-function and associated combinatorial objects.

## Main Theoretical Results

### Log-Concavity and the Riemann Hypothesis

**Theorem**: If the Riemann hypothesis holds, then the sequence of Taylor coefficients $(\lambda_k)$ of the Riemann $\xi$-function is **infinitely log-concave**.

*Proof Idea*: This result stems from the property that the $\xi$-function is in the Laguerre-Pólya class if all zeros are real (the Riemann Hypothesis). Infinite log-concavity is preserved in this class because real-rooted generating functions imply iterated log-concavity by Newton’s inequalities, and the $\mathcal{L}$ operator preserves real-rootedness.

**Theorem**: Unconditionally, the sequence $(\lambda_k)$ is **6-log-concave**—that is, the sequence and its first six $\mathcal{L}$-iterates remain nonnegative.

*Computational confirmation*: Rigorous numerical work, supported by theoretical matrix positivity checks and Turán inequality verifications, establishes the 6-log-concavity property for hundreds of Taylor coefficients of the Riemann $\xi$-function. This provides compelling computational evidence in support of the infinite log-concavity conjecture.

**Conjecture**: The sequence $(\lambda_k)$ is always **infinitely log-concave**, independent of the full truth of the Riemann hypothesis.

### Log-Concavity for $q$-Analogues and Combinatorial Structures

The framework extends to **$q$-log-concavity** for polynomial sequences such as $q$-binomial coefficients, $q$-Stirling numbers, and Boros–Moll polynomials, demonstrating 3-log-concavity for these objects. These results connect log-concavity in analytic number theory to broader combinatorial phenomena. The proofs employ total positivity of matrices and Newton-type inequalities applied in the $q$-analogous setting.

### Turán-type and Higher-Order Inequalities

Verification of **Turán inequalities** (i.e., $a_k^2 \geq a_{k-1} a_{k+1}$) for the Taylor coefficients of the Riemann $\xi$-function, as proven by Pólya, Csordas, Varga, and others, forms the necessary analytical foundation for the broader log-concavity conjecture. Even higher-order Turán inequalities have been confirmed computationally and theoretically, fortifying connections to Jensen polynomial hyperbolicity.

## Definition and Properties of the Log-Concave Transform

The **log-concave transform operator $\mathcal{L}$** is central:
$$
\mathcal{L}(\alpha) = (b_k)_{k \geq 0},\,\, b_k = a_k^2 - a_{k-1}a_{k+1}.
$$
Iterating $\mathcal{L}$ gives a sequence with increasing orders of log-concavity; if all iterates are nonnegative, the sequence is infinitely log-concave.

For sequences whose generating functions have only real zeros—i.e., sequences arising from entire functions in the Laguerre–Pólya class—the $\mathcal{L}$ operator preserves the real-rootedness property. This fact, coupled with Newton’s and Turán’s inequalities, means infinite log-concavity is not merely an analytic curiosity but a property signaling deep regularity in the sequence structure, with connections to powerful number-theoretic hypotheses such as RH.

Beyond pure sequences, the log-concave transform generalizes to functions: for $f$ twice differentiable, log-concavity is detected by the sign of $(f'(x))^2 - f(x)f''(x)$, and thus $\log f$ is concave if and only if the above expression is nonnegative. In multivariate settings, log-concave densities enjoy closure under convolution, marginalization, and affine transformations, which underlies their foundational role in geometry and probability as well as analytic number theory.

## Computational Methods and Algorithms

### Enumeration of Log-Concavity

Verification of $r$-log-concavity for a given sequence involves calculating successive $\mathcal{L}^i$ transforms up to the desired $r$, and checking nonnegativity at each stage. For polynomially defined combinatorial sequences, symbolic algebra tools and analytic arguments about total positivity allow proofs for all $n$.

### Explicit Calculations for $\xi$-Function Coefficients

For the Riemann $\xi$-function:
- Taylor coefficients are computed by high-precision numerical quadrature of integrals of rapidly decaying modular or theta functions.
- The log-concave transform is applied iteratively, with explicit inequalities—such as $b_k = \lambda_k^2 - \lambda_{k-1}\lambda_{k+1} \geq 0$—tested for each $k$ and each iterated sequence.
- The 6-log-concavity is established for hundreds or thousands of coefficients using this process.

### $q$-Analog Computations

For $q$-binomial coefficients and related sequences:
- Recurrence relations and generating function properties reduce the verification of log-concavity to manageable computations.
- Symbolic software and explicit combinatorial interpretations support rigorous verification up to a given $q$-degree.

### Numerical Validation and Total Positivity

Matrix total positivity—where all minors are nonnegative—can be checked efficiently for moderate matrix sizes, allowing validation that certain linear transformations preserve log-concavity of sequences.

## Experimental Results and Numerical Evidence

### Log-Concavity in the Riemann $\xi$-Function

- **Empirical results** confirm that the first several hundred Taylor coefficients of the Riemann $\xi$-function not only are positive but also 6-log-concave, with strong numerical evidence supporting conjectured infinite log-concavity.
- Iterates of $\mathcal{L}$ applied to these coefficients remain nonnegative as far as calculated, despite the increasing analytical complexity.
- **Turán-type inequalities** and even higher-order inequalities are numerically validated for substantial ranges of $k$ in $(\lambda_k)$, further reinforcing their tightly controlled structure.

### Log-Concavity in $q$-Analogues

Computational experiments reveal:
- The 3-log-concavity property for $q$-binomial coefficients and many $q$-Stirling numbers—expanded to high $n$—holds universally in the tested domain, with symbolic calculations confirming total positivity criteria where feasible.

### Application to Boros–Moll and Combinatorial Polynomials

Numerical and symbolic calculations support not only ordinary log-concavity but also iterated log-concavity properties (e.g., for the Boros–Moll polynomials), matching theoretical predictions and conjectures raised in the 1990s and 2000s.

## Theoretical Implications for Prime Distributions

### Connection to the Riemann Hypothesis

The infinite log-concavity (and, equivalently, real-rootedness of all Jensen polynomials of the coefficients) is **equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis**—one of mathematics' deepest unsolved problems. If proved, this would establish that all zeros of the Riemann $\xi$-function (and thus the $\zeta$-function) are real, tightly correlating with the predicted regularity in the distribution of primes.

### Jensen Polynomials and Prime Regularity

Recent work shows that the Jensen polynomials associated with the $\xi$-function not only have implications for hyperbolicity conjectures but also exhibit asymptotic behavior similar to Hermite polynomials under scaling. The **hyperbolicity of these Jensen polynomials**—established for large degrees—relates to the expected local statistics of zeros (governed by random matrix theory) and thus to the fine structure of prime gaps.

### Log-Concavity and Distribution of Zeros

The log-concavity of the Taylor coefficients is intimately connected with **the reality of zeros of the $\xi$-function**, and hence, via the explicit formula and the Riemann–von Mangoldt formula, to the oscillations in $\pi(x)$ and related functions—thereby providing a deeper statistical balance in prime distribution.

### Prime Number Theorem and Turán Inequalities

Turán-type inequalities give necessary (though not sufficient) constraints for a sequence to correspond to a function with only real zeros, thus translating into concrete, computationally accessible properties that must be satisfied if the prime number theorem (and its error terms) are to reflect deeper regularity as posited by the Riemann hypothesis.

## Open Questions and Conjectures

1. **Infinite Log-Concavity**: Is the sequence $(\lambda_k)$ of the Riemann $\xi$-function’s Taylor coefficients always infinitely log-concave? No counterexamples have emerged, and extensive computational work supports the conjecture, but a complete proof remains elusive.

2. **Stronger $q$-Analogs**: Can the $q$-log-concavity framework be further generalized, for instance, to new families of $q$-analogue sequences or combinatorial objects?

3. **Laguerre-Pólya Characterization**: Can a more refined characterization of when an entire function arising from such transformations resides in the Laguerre–Pólya class yield decisive progress toward—or even a proof of—the Riemann hypothesis?

4. **Higher-Order Turán Inequalities**: How far do higher-order Turán inequalities (e.g., those involving more distant terms in the sequence) coincide with RH predictions? What is their genuine reach in sequence or function classification?

5. **Total Positivity Criteria**: Does every totally positive sequence transform by $\mathcal{L}$ into another totally positive sequence of possibly lower order? This touches deep combinatorial and analytic territory.

6. **Preservation under Nonlinear Transformations**: While linear transformations preserving log-concavity are increasingly well-understood, what about nonlinear transformation classes, and how do they interact with root structure and prime distributions?

## Conclusions and Future Directions

The research into **log-concave transforms of the Riemann $\xi$-function** illuminates a rich intersection between analytic number theory, combinatorial sequence analysis, and spectral theory. The demonstration of 6-log-concavity, and the broader quest for infinite log-concavity, aligns with the classical pursuit of the Riemann hypothesis—effectively bridging the gap between discrete (combinatorial) and continuous (analytic) approaches to understanding primes.

**Future work** is likely to focus on:
1. **Formal Proofs of Infinite Log-Concavity**: Achieving theoretical clarity—potentially via total positivity and matrix theory—to move from large $r$-log-concavity to infinite regimes.
2. **Deeper $q$-Analogue Structures**: Uncovering the full range of functions and polynomials where $q$-log-concavity persists, possibly illuminating new combinatorial invariants.
3. **Broader Applications and Connections**: Extending these ideas to other zeta and $L$-functions, seeking analogues of log-concavity which may inform questions about the behavior of other arithmetic sequences or random matrix models.
4. **Computational Expansion**: Utilization of advanced numerical methods to further test, both broadly and deeply, the stability and pervasiveness of log-concavity in various number-theoretic contexts.
5. **Functional and Geometric Dualities**: Exploiting the role of dualities (e.g., via Legendre transforms) in log-concave theory, potentially yielding new functional inequalities or convex geometric analogues pertinent to prime number theory.

The landscape forged by these studies not only enriches combinatorics and analysis but also forges new pathways toward a more unified theory explaining the regularity of prime numbers—a quest at the very heart of mathematics.
