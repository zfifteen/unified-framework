- **Incorporate Exact Sympy Computations**: Replace the current trial-division `is_prime` and `_divisor_count` with SymPy's `isprime` and `divisor_count` for higher precision and efficiency, especially for larger N_POINTS; this aligns with cognitive-number-theory's emphasis on accurate divisor density in κ(n) = d(n) ⋅ ln(n)/e², reducing errors in curvature calculations.
- **Dynamic Prime Gap Integration**: Modify the `prime_gap` parameter in `__call__` to use actual gaps from consecutive primes (e.g., via a precomputed list), scaled by π as in prime_number_geometry's Z(n) = n ⋅ prime_gap / π, for more precise y-warping that reflects true distribution irregularities.
- **Optimize Helix Frequency with Golden Ratio**: Tune HELIX_FREQ dynamically using φ (golden ratio) from prime_curve's θ'(n, k) ≈ φ ⋅ ((n mod φ)/φ)^k at optimal k≈0.3, such as HELIX_FREQ = 1/(2⋅π⋅φ), to enhance helical resonance and prime clustering visibility in z-coordinates.
- **Enhance Curvature with Z-Metric Variants**: Update `_compute_curvature` to include z_metric's Z-resonance ((n mod ln(n)) ⋅ d(n)/e) or lightprimes' Z_κ(p_i) = 2⋅ln(p_i)/e² for primes, providing finer-grained warping that separates twin primes as minimal-curvature geodesics.
- **Apply Frame Shift Corrections Bidirectionally**: Integrate universal_frame_shift_transformer's UniversalFrameShift class for inverse transforms in y and z, using rate ≈ e/π and invariant C=e, to correct observational biases and achieve ~35x density improvements in visualized clusters.
- **Add Neural Forecasting Layer**: From lightprimes, incorporate a simple Torch MLP (e.g., 2→20→1 layers) for online fine-tuning of Z-corrections, predicting ΔZ based on inputs [n, δ_i] and applying sigmoid constraints, to refine y-values for emerging "prime news" in large n.
- **Implement Vortex Pre-Filtering**: Extend the `apply_vortex_filter` to pre-process n_vals, eliminating ~71.3% composites as in z_metric, then plot only candidates with color gradients by Z-vector magnitude (√(curvature² + resonance²)) for sharper prime highlights.
- **Scale to Higher Dimensions with PCA**: Project the 3D plot into a holographic manifold using lightprimes' 16D Z-embeddings, then reduce via SciPy's PCA to 3D for visualization, revealing geodesic extrapolations and improving separation accuracy.
- **Increase Resolution and Log Scaling**: Boost N_POINTS to 100,000+ and apply logarithmic scaling to the y-axis (e.g., ax.set_yscale('log')), drawing from cognitive-number-theory's ln(n) terms, to handle density variations without clipping high-curvature composites.
- **Add Spectral Disruption Metrics**: Inspired by wave-crispr-signal's FFT-based features (Δf₁, ΔEntropy), apply Fourier transforms to helical z-coordinates, coloring points by spectral disruption scores to quantify and visualize prime pattern anomalies more precisely.
