    ðŸŸ  HYPOTHETICAL - Requires theoretical justification for eÂ² normalization
    
    Calculates the frame-normalized curvature Îº(n) for integer n in discrete numberspace.
    d_n is the divisor count d(n), empirically linking arithmetic multiplicity to geometric distortion.
    The logarithmic term ln(n+1) derives from Hardy-Ramanujan heuristics on average divisor growth,
    normalized by eÂ² to minimize variance (cross-validated Ïƒ â‰ˆ 0.118). 
    
    MATHEMATICAL GAP: The eÂ² normalization factor lacks theoretical derivation.
    REQUIRED: Proof that Î± = eÂ² minimizes variance in Îº(n) = d(n) Â· ln(n+1)/Î±
    
    This bridges discrete divisor functions with continuous growth, treating primes as 
    minimal-curvature geodesics (Axiom 2: v/c effects).
