Title: Irreducibility Analysis of Golden-Ratio-Curved Prime Transition Matrices

Author: Big D
Date: 2025-08-01

Description:
This executable scientific white paper tests the hypothesis that the transition matrix T(k),
constructed from a golden-ratio-based curvature transformation of prime numbers, remains irreducible
across a wide range of curvature exponents k.

Irreducibility of T(k) implies the graph formed by curved prime transitions is strongly connected—
i.e., every prime state can be reached from any other. This ensures ergodicity and a unique
stationary distribution, analogous to stability and causality in dynamical systems.

The transformation:
    theta(p, k) = φ * ((p mod φ) / φ)^k
maps each prime p into a curved value using the golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618.
This represents a nonlinear, frame-dependent reshaping of prime "space," inspired by relativistic
geometry, where k acts as a curvature exponent. The hypothesis is falsified if, for any k tested,
T(k) becomes reducible (i.e., the graph breaks into disconnected components).

This provides a falsifiable test for structural invariance in the distribution of primes under
nonlinear transformations, potentially linking number theory with spectral graph theory and
dynamical systems.
