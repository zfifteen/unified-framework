# Test Finding Results

This directory contains all output files from tests, experiments, and analyses including JSON data, CSV files, NumPy arrays, and other structured results.

## Contents

### Result Categories
- **JSON Files**: Structured analysis results, metrics, and statistical data
- **CSV Files**: Tabular data exports and time series results  
- **NPY Files**: NumPy array data for mathematical computations
- **TXT Files**: Plain text outputs, summaries, and reports

### Result Types
- Mathematical validation results
- Statistical analysis outputs
- Prime number analysis data
- Quantum entanglement measurements
- Curvature analysis metrics
- Zeta function computations

## Organization

Results are organized by:
- Source analysis or test
- Data type and format
- Computational scope (small, medium, large scale)

## Usage

Results can be loaded and analyzed using standard Python libraries:
```python
import json
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load JSON results
with open('test-finding/results/[result_file].json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Load NumPy arrays
array_data = np.load('test-finding/results/[result_file].npy')
```

## LLM Analysis Notes

- All result files are well-structured for programmatic analysis
- File naming conventions indicate content and scope
- Metadata preserved for traceability
- Cross-references maintained for source scripts
