### 🔬 **Empirical Findings**

Using the transformation:

$$
\theta(p, k) = \phi \cdot \left(\frac{p \bmod M}{M}\right)^k \mod 24
$$

we tested clustering of the first 100,000 primes over a 24-hour clock, across:

* Curvature exponents $k \in \{0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0\}$
* Moduli $M \in \{ \sqrt{2}, \pi, e, 2.05, 2.10, 2.15, \phi^\phi \approx 2.178 \}$

### 📈 **Top Clustering Effects (by χ² Statistic)**

| Rank | Modulus      | $k$  | χ² Value  | p-value  |
| ---- | ------------ | ---- | --------- | -------- |
| 1    | 2.100000     | 0.05 | 499,500.6 | < 10⁻³⁰⁰ |
| 2    | 2.150000     | 0.05 | 472,060.9 | < 10⁻³⁰⁰ |
| 3    | 2.050000     | 0.05 | 469,799.5 | < 10⁻³⁰⁰ |
| 4    | √2 ≈ 1.4142  | 0.05 | 465,095.2 | < 10⁻³⁰⁰ |
| 5    | φ^φ ≈ 2.1785 | 0.05 | 463,126.6 | < 10⁻³⁰⁰ |

### 🧪 Interpretation

* All moduli at **low k** exhibit **extreme non-uniformity** (very high χ²), **not just φ^φ**.
* The clustering **intensifies as $k \to 0$** for all tested moduli.
* Thus, the golden ratio curvature resonance is **not unique** to φ^φ — but φ^φ still ranks among the top.

| **2. Clustering increases as $k \to 0$**            | ✅      | All top χ² values at k = 0.05                         |
| **3. Effect is unique to φ^φ**                      | ❌      | Nearby values (e.g. 2.10) produce stronger clustering |
| **4. Other irrationals don’t show this**            | ❌      | √2 produced comparable χ²                             |

### 🧠 Next Steps

To recover uniqueness or relevance of φ^φ, we need to:

* Define a **sharper resonance metric** beyond χ² (e.g., **alignment with specific clock positions**)
* Isolate **bin-level signal** (e.g., repeated spikes at 6 & 18 only for φ^φ)
* Explore **Fourier structure** or autocorrelation in the mappings

Would you like to proceed with refining the resonance definition, or develop a normalized resonance score that penalizes overly chaotic clustering?
