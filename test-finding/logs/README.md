# Test Finding Logs

This directory contains log files, execution outputs, and runtime information from test executions and experimental runs.

## Contents

### Log Types
- **Execution Logs**: Runtime output from test scripts
- **Error Logs**: Debugging information and error traces
- **Performance Logs**: Timing and resource usage data
- **Analysis Logs**: Step-by-step computation records
- **Validation Logs**: Verification and checkpoint data

### File Formats
- **TXT Files**: Plain text log outputs
- **JSON Files**: Structured log data and metrics
- **LOG Files**: Standard application log format

## Organization

Logs are organized by:
- Execution date and time
- Source script or analysis
- Log level and type
- Computational scope

## Usage

Logs can be analyzed for:
- Debugging failed tests
- Performance optimization
- Validation of results
- Reproduction of experiments

```bash
# View recent logs
tail -f test-finding/logs/[log_file].txt

# Search for specific patterns
grep -n "ERROR" test-finding/logs/[log_file].txt
```

## Retention Policy

- Recent logs kept for active development
- Historical logs archived for reproducibility
- Critical results logs preserved permanently
- Debug logs cleaned periodically

## LLM Analysis Notes

- Timestamps preserved for chronological analysis
- Error patterns documented for troubleshooting
- Performance metrics tracked for optimization
- Cross-references maintained to source executions
