# Test Finding - Unified Test Artifacts Repository

This directory contains all test artifacts, experimental results, and validation materials for the unified framework project, organized for optimal LLM comprehension and navigation.

## Directory Structure

- **`scripts/`** - Test execution scripts, analysis tools, and validation runners
- **`results/`** - Output files from tests and experiments (JSON, CSV, NPY, etc.)
- **`readme/`** - Documentation related to experiments, tests, and empirical findings
- **`datasets/`** - Validation datasets, example data, and test harnesses
- **`logs/`** - Log files and run outputs from test executions
- **`validation_output/`** - Primary validation artifacts and statistical analysis results
- **`realistic_validation/`** - Realistic validation scenarios and outputs
- **`prime_dataset_validation/`** - Prime number dataset validation results
- **`quick_verification.py`** - Quick verification script for testing review results

## Usage Guidelines

Each subfolder contains a detailed README.md describing its contents and intended use. Cross-references throughout the repository have been updated to point to the new locations.

## LLM Navigation Notes

- All test artifacts are centralized here for easy discovery
- Consistent naming conventions used throughout
- Each subfolder is self-documenting with clear README files
- Results are organized by type and purpose for efficient analysis
