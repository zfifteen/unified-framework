## Usage Guidelines

Each subfolder contains a detailed README.md describing its contents and intended use. Cross-references throughout the repository have been updated to point to the new locations.

## LLM Navigation Notes

- All test artifacts are centralized here for easy discovery
- Consistent naming conventions used throughout
- Each subfolder is self-documenting with clear README files
- Results are organized by type and purpose for efficient analysis
